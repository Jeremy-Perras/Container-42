### What is Container ?
 Container is a individual project at 42 but is was a bit hard alone so we decided to make it with [someone](https://github.com/crisCiobanu/42_containers). The purpose is to re-implement container from library C++.
 
### What is it ?
Vector : Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
LIFO stack : Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.
Map : Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order.
Set : Sets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order.
Rbtree : is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree
